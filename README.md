## End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project. Below are the steps to get started:

### Environment Setup

1. Create a new conda environment named `mlproj` with Python 3.9:
   ```
   conda create -n mlproj python==3.9 -y
   ```

2. Activate the `mlproj` environment:
   ```
   conda activate mlproj
   ```

### Configuration

- Update the `config.yaml`: Modify paths and configurations as needed.
- Update the `schema.yaml`: Define the schema for model training.
- Update the `params.yaml`: Set parameters for the project.
- Update the entity: Ensure all relevant entities are updated with correct information.

### Development

- Update configuration managers in `src/config`.
- Update components such as data ingestion, preprocessing, etc.
- Update the pipeline and upgrade it according to requirements.
- Update `main.py`: Trigger the execution of the pipeline.
- Update `app.py` as necessary.

### Running the Project

1. Execute `main.py` to run the project pipeline:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Access the local server:
   ```
   Local_Host: http://127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to update all relevant files and configurations according to your project requirements.
- Review and test the project thoroughly to ensure proper functionality.
- Refer to the documentation within the codebase for detailed explanations of each component.

By following these steps and instructions, you can set up and run the end-to-end machine learning project successfully. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please refer to the documentation or reach out for assistance.
